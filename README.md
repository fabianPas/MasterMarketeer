# MasterMarketeer
A [Puzzle Pirates Dark Seas](store.steampowered.com/app/552110/Puzzle_Pirates_Dark_Seas/) Commodity Market collector created for the Puzzle Pirates community using The Java Access Bridge to collect the market data from the Java window.

### How to use

- Build the project using Visual Studio 2017.
- Open Puzzle Pirates Dark Seas via Steam.
- Open up the commodity on the island you want to collect the data from.
- Run the application.
- Select the island your on.
- Press "collect".
- By default a JSON value will be created with the market data in it.

#### Options

By default a JSON file will be exported, but also CSV files are supported. If you want to use CSV files instead, open up the `exe.config` file and change the `json` value to `csv`.

#### Troubleshooting

If the MasterMarketeer throws an error, it could be that the Java Access Bridge is not enabled on your system yet. Run the following command to enable the Java Access Bridge. Make sure to restart YPP after if it wasn't shutdown yet.

```C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\%JRE_HOME%\bin\jabswitch -enable```
