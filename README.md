# MasterMarketeer
A [Puzzle Pirates Dark Seas](store.steampowered.com/app/552110/Puzzle_Pirates_Dark_Seas/) Commodity Market collector created for the Puzzle Pirates community using The Java Access Bridge to collect the market data from the Java window.

### How to use

- Build the project using Visual Studio 2017.
- Open Puzzle Pirates Dark Seas via Steam.
- Open up the commodity on the island you want to collect the data from.
- Run the application.
- Select the island your on.
- Press "collect".
- By default a JSON value will be created with the market data in it.

#### Options

By default a JSON file will be exported, but also CSV files are supported. If you want to use CSV files instead, open up the `exe.config` file and change the `json` value to `csv`.
